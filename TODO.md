Support building by git tags
----------------------------

	add support for selecting git ref. pull ref from the environment (SENSU_GIT_REF):
		sensu.rake recipe
		Vagrantfile
		build.sh

	remove SENSU_VERSION from environment and replace with automated
	way to determine Sensu::VERSION. Might have to do a clone
	of sensu git repo at the very beginning of the Rakefile and load the
	lib to find the version. ugly, but possible?
